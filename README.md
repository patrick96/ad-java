# Algorithms and Data Structures in Java

As a preparation for my "Algorithms and Data Structures" exam, I will implement some of them here using java.

## TODO
I have not yet implemented anything, expect the first programs soon.

I plan to implement the following algorithms and abstract data types/data structures, it is possible that I will not do all of them, either because I don't have time or because I deem some of them too time-consuming for the benefit they give me.
Whenever I finish implementing something, I will tick it off here.

### Algorithms
- [ ] Binary Search
- [ ] Linear Search
- [ ] Interpolation Search (maybe)
- [ ] Bubblesort
- [ ] Insertionsort
- [ ] Selectionsort
- [ ] Mergesort
- [ ] Heapsort
- [ ] Quicksort
- [ ] DFS / BFS
- [ ] Topological Order
- [ ] Dijkstra
- [ ] Transitive Closure
- [ ] Min. Spaning Tree

### ADT / Data Structures
- [ ] Stack / Multistack
- [ ] Queue
- [ ] Priority Queue (using a binary Heap)
- [ ] Binary Searchtree
- [ ] AVL Tree
- [ ] Union-Find
